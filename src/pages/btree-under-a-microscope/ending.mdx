Wow, that was much longer than I expected. Congratulations if you've made it
this far. Hopefully, you left this post with a bit more knowledge about B-Tree.
Despite being half a century old, this data structure still has some intriguing
concepts and new developments.

If you have any queries or modification suggestions, please open an issue or PR on GitHub.
