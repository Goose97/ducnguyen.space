We can apply a number of optimizations on the baseline design of B-Tree,
each with different trade-offs. They aim to provide more compact tree
structure, better tree navigation or optimize cache utilization.

## Sibling pointers

The name is self-explanatory: adding pointers to the left or right sibling to
each node. Effectively, each level will become a linked list (or even a doubly
linked list). This helps us quickly traverse the tree, which is useful during
range scans. This technique is applied in many variations, both B+ Tree and B
Link Tree as, we discussed previously.

## Key normalization

This technique encodes keys into a binary string. The encoding scheme must
preserve the key sorted order and comparison result. In another word, if A is
greater than B, then the normalization of A is also greater than the normalization
of B, and vice versa.

<div class="w-[50ch] flex mx-auto my-5 tabular-nums font-mono">
  <div class="flex flex-col flex-1">
    <span class="font-semibold text-center border-b border-gray-400 mx-4 mb-2">Original</span>
    <span class="text-center leading-10">(<span class="text-primary-600">Baz</span>, <span class="text-secondary-600">12</span>)</span>
    <span class="text-center leading-10">(<span class="text-primary-600">Bar</span>, <span class="text-secondary-600">42</span>)</span>
  </div>
  <div class="flex flex-col flex-1">
    <span class="font-semibold text-center border-b border-gray-400 mx-4 mb-2">Normalized</span>
    <span class="text-center leading-10">
      <span class="text-primary-600">10001101001</span>
      <span class="text-secondary-600">00001100</span>
    </span>
    <span class="text-center leading-10">
      <span class="text-primary-600">10001100011</span>
      <span class="text-secondary-600">00101010</span>
    </span>
  </div>
</div>

Key normalization improves overall performance since binary strings are faster
to compare (we basically compare integers). A simple `memcmp` is all we need in
all cases. But the true power of this technique is that **binary strings are
extremely flexible**. Normalized keys are essentially strings of bytes, or
strings of wider integers that can be easily concatenated, inverted, and
truncated. This optimization unlocks a whole set of other optimizations:
**prefix compression** and **suffix truncation**, which we will discuss later.

However, there are several drawbacks:

<ol class="list-decimal pl-10">
  <li>The normalized key tends to be bigger than the original key.</li>
  <li>We cannot recover the original key from the normalized one. This affects
    cases where the original key is required, for example, PostgreSQL
    index-only scans. To alleviate this, implementations can apply
    normalization only on internal nodes. We don't need their original values,
    we just need to perform comparisons.</li>
</ol>

## Prefix compression

Consider this sorted sequence of keys inside a node:

<div class="w-fit flex gap-8 mx-auto my-5 font-mono">
  <span><span class="text-primary-600">app</span>le</span>
  <span><span class="text-primary-600">app</span>lication</span>
  <span><span class="text-primary-600">app</span>lication_logs</span>
  <span><span class="text-primary-600">apr</span>icot</span>
</div>

Notice the common prefix? How about we only store it once? That's the exact
idea of prefix compression. It can significantly reduce the key size, which
leads to more keys in internal nodes. And as we mentioned times and times
before, higher fanout means faster B-Tree. Also, comparisons when searching
don't need to consider the prefix part.

The sorted nature of B-Tree enables this optimization. Since keys are ordered,
neighbor keys are similar. In fact, they can be equal in the first few leading
bytes, or even all bytes in case they are duplicated.

It's possible to perform prefix compression without key normalization. But
it would require a fair deal of bookeeping, even if they were applied only to
entire key fields rather than to individual bytes. With key normalization, the
implementation is straightforward, since all keys are just binary strings.

In the context of database indexes, prefix compression effects can be significant
in certain cases. A typical multi-column index, especially with leading fields
as foreign keys, might look like this:

<div class="w-full flex flex-col font-mono my-5">
  <span class="leading-10">Table: customer_addresses</span>
  <div class="flex flex-col mx-auto">
    <span class="font-semibold text-center border-b border-gray-400 px-4 mb-2">Index: (country_id, city_id)</span>
    <span class="text-center leading-10">(Viet Nam, Ha Noi)</span>
    <span class="text-center leading-10">(Viet Nam, Ha Noi)</span>
    <span class="text-center leading-10">(Viet Nam, Hai Phong)</span>
    <span class="text-center leading-10">(Viet Nam, Sai Gon)</span>
  </div>
</div>

Foreign keys increase the chance of encountering duplicate values. In the above
example (though contrived), suffix compression can easily reduce the node size
by a third. The trade-off is the added complexity and runtime overhead
(*original keys must be recreated on every operation*). Sometimes, it's not
worth it if the tree doesn't have that many duplicated keys.

## Suffix truncation

Imagine we have a leaf node like this and we need to split it due to a new
insert. Let say we split right in the middle. What should the separator key be?

<div class="flex flex-col items-center mt-5 mb-9 font-mono">
  <span>Separator key: <span class="text-primary-600">???</span></span>
  <div class="w-fit relative flex justify-center gap-8 border border-gray-400 mx-auto mt-4 px-8 py-4">
    <div class="flex gap-8">
      <span>Amy</span>
      <span>Boyle</span>
      <span>Holt</span>
    </div>
    <div class="absolute left-1/2 -top-4 -bottom-4 -translate-x-[0.5ch] w-[2px] line-dashed-vertical"></div>
    <div class="flex gap-8">
      <span>Jake</span>
      <span>Rosa</span>
      <span>Terry</span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

The simplest solution is to choose the lowest value from the right node, `Jake`.
But can we do better? Remember, the only function of separator keys is to
divide the key space into two halves. One is strictly smaller than it, and the
other one is greater or equal to it. We can choose any value, as long as it does
its job.

In this case, `J` is the optimal choice. Part of the original key `Jake` gets
truncated, hence the name suffix truncation.

<div class="mx-auto my-5 w-fit font-mono">
  <span>Amy, Boyle, Holt &lt; <span class="text-primary-600">J</span> &lt; Jake, Rosa, Terry</span>
</div>

If performing suffix truncation on arbitrary bytes like the above example is
complex, you can apply it to the whole index field. Let's bring back the
*customer_addresses* table example.

<div class="w-fit flex flex-col font-mono my-5 mx-auto">
  <div class="flex flex-col mx-auto">
    <span class="font-semibold text-center border-b border-gray-400 px-4 mb-2">Index: (country_id, city_id)</span>
    <span class="text-center leading-10">(USA, Los Angeles)</span>
    <span class="text-center leading-10">(USA, New York)</span>
    <div class="w-full h-[2px] line-dashed-horizontal"></div>
    <span class="text-center leading-10">(Viet Nam, Ha Noi)</span>
    <span class="text-center leading-10">(Viet Nam, Sai Gon)</span>
  </div>
</div>

If we split right in the middle, we can choose `(Viet Nam, -∞)` as the
separator key. The negative infinity can be compactly represented to save bytes,
similar to how databases represent NULL values. These negative infinity can
also make comparisons faster since we can add a fast path specifically for
them.

Similar to prefix compression, this technique aims to reduce the key size and
leads to higher fanout. A B-Tree implementation with suffix truncation is
sometimes said to be a "prefix B-Tree". Key normalization greatly simplifies
the implementation and increases the effectiveness, as we only have to deal
with binary strings as keys.

That said, suffix truncation has one disadvantage. It can't be applied to leaf
nodes, just internal nodes. For the same reason in prefix compression, it's not
possible to recover the original keys. The internal nodes only make up about 1%
of the total tree size, Therefore, the size reduction is often not noticeable.

<Callout title="Picking a split point">
  <p>With suffix truncation enabled, sometimes it's better <b>not</b> to split
    at the middle but rather pick a split point, which yields a smaller
    separator key. Sounds odd, right?</p>
  <p>Consider this case:</p>
  <div class="w-fit flex justify-center gap-8 mx-auto my-4 font-mono">
    <span>John Lennon</span>
    <span>John Smith</span>
    <span>John Wick</span>
    <span>Micheal Kane</span>
  </div>
  <p>If we split in the middle, the best separator key we can do is `John W`.
    But if we accept an uneven split and split after the third element, the
    separator key would be `M`. An interesting trade-off to consider.</p>
</Callout>

## Poor man's normalized keys

So far, we mentioned optimizations applied to the key level. Let's zoom out a
little bit and look at B-Tree nodes. As we mentioned in Part 2, B-Tree node
with variable length keys is commonly implemented as slotted page.

<Image src={slottedPage} alt="An illustration of slotted page disk representation" class="custom-image" />

This scheme incurs some extra cost of memory accesses when searching
for keys. Each jump during binary search will require two memory accesses: one
for the **offset pointer** and one for the **key content**. For instance, if
our node has 16 keys, we will need at most 10 accesses.

One trick is to store a few leading bytes of the key along with the offset pointer,
basically making it "fat". Let's consider this example when we search for
`avocado` key:

<div class="w-fit flex justify-center gap-8 mx-auto my-5">
  <span><span class="text-primary-600">app</span>le</span>
  <span><span class="text-primary-600">apr</span>icot</span>
  <span><span class="text-primary-600">ban</span>ana</span>
  <span><span class="text-primary-600">che</span>rry</span>
</div>

With 3 leading bytes, we can confidently say that the key does not exist
without ever touching the actual keys. This is because those tiny bits of the
original keys are **enough to distinguish them**. This fixed-size prefix is
typically called a *poor man's normalized key* in literature.

Nonetheless, this technique only works well if prefix compression presents. With
common prefix truncated away, even a small poor man key (2 or 4 bytes) is
enough to avoid some memory accesses. Otherwise, even a large poor man key
might not be effective, especially in the leaf nodes, where keys are highly similar.
