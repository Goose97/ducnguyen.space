B-Tree is ubiquitous and appears everywhere, especially in the database realm.
You can find a B-Tree implementation in almost every database nowadays,
typically used for indexing. But why is that?

<Callout title="Memory vs Disk storage">
  <p>Memory-based and disk-based storage have vastly different characteristics.
    We will discuss only the case when data is too big to fit into memory and
    has to store on disk. This scenario highlights the strength of B-Tree.</p>
</Callout>

## Data structure for disk

### Low height

If you look at the anatomy of the lookup process of tree data structures (binary
tree or B-Tree), there are two primary operations: comparison and pointer
reference. At each level, you perform some comparisons to determine the next
subtree. Then, you reference to the pointer to read the subtree.

The cost of comparison stays relatively constant, while the cost of pointer
reference relies on the storage medium. Disk access is several orders of
magnitude slower than memory access, making the cost of pointer references
the dominant part. When designing data structures for disk-based
storage, minimizing storage access is crucial. Often times, the number of
storage accesses is proportional to the tree height. A data structure with
**low height** is a desired property.

### High fanout
<p>
  Disk storage is represented as
  <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_file#Block_devices"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    class="link">block devices</a>.
  It organizes data into fixed-sized blocks (typically 4 KB), and each
  block has a unique address. Read and write operations are performed on entire
  blocks. Which means, to read/write a single byte, you must read/write the
  whole block containing it. This contrasts with character devices, which you
  can operate on byte or character level.
</p>

Let's look at binary tree. With each pointer reference, we will read a node,
which contains two children pointers. We can give a rough estimate of the node
size: 128 bytes (a node value and two pointers). As we mention above, we must
read the entire block (i.e. 4 KB). What should we do with the remaining bytes.
How can we best utilize it?

One idea is to pack as much **relevant** data as possible into a single block.
Relevant is a loosely defined term. Let's say, two pieces of data, A and
B, are relevant. If A is accessed, B is likely to be accessed soon after, and
vice versa. We say that a data structure has better *data locality*
if relevant data are placed in close proximity on the storage medium.

If the problem with binary tree is that it has too few children, how about we
crank it up? A **higher fanout** leads to more keys per node, which can better
utilize the disk block. Neighboring keys are relevant to each other, especially
when performing range scan operation.

### B-Tree is a good fit

To recap, we want a data structure with:

<ul class="list-disc pl-10">
  <li><strong>Low height</strong> to minimize disk accesses.</li>
  <li><strong>High fanout</strong> to improve data locality.</li>
</ul>

<Callout title="Height and fanout">
  <p>Height and fanout are inversely correlated: the higher the fanout, the
    lower the height. If the fanout is high, each node can hold more children,
    thus requiring fewer levels to hold the entire amount of keys.</p>
</Callout>

B-Tree checks both of these boxes. Also, B-Tree is a self-balancing structure,
ensuring consistent performance for all operations. To maximize the I/O
efficiency, the node size of B-Tree should align with block device size. For
example, if the block size is 4 KB, the node size can be 4 KB (most common), or
8 KB, 16 KB, … (less common).

Another point in favor of B-Tree: It's an **ordered data structure**. It can
efficiently support range scan query, which is common in databases.

## Modifications for databases

B-Tree is a good fit for databases. However, we need to make some adjustments
to work in the database context.

### Variable size records

In Part 1, we only talked about B-Tree with fixed-size keys and values. For
databases, we need to handle variable-size data. Our current design has a few
issues:

<ul class="list-disc pl-10">
  <li>We perform binary search to look for keys in the nodes. It won’t work if
    the key sizes are different.</li>
  <li>We should maintain the keys in sorted order. Keeping an array of
    different size elements sorted is a big hassle.</li>
</ul>

One solution a lot of database implementations employ is introducing a layer of
indirection. We divide a node into two sections; one stores the keys and
associated data, and the other stores the pointer to the keys. We also reserve
some space for metadata about the node in the page header.

<Image src={slottedPage} alt="An illustration of slotted page disk representation" class="custom-image" />

The pointers section starts from the left end. The cells section, where keys
and associated data are stored, starts from the right end. The pointers store the
byte offset of the cells. They’re analogous to the pointers in the traditional
sense, but instead of pointing to a memory address, they point to a location on
the node.

Let’s examine how the basic operations should update to adapt with this new change:

<ul class="list-disc pl-10">
  <li><b>Insert</b>: Upon insertions, the pointers section grows to the right,
    whereas the cells section grows to the left. Remember, we need to keep the
    pointers section sorted, so after insert, some ordering is necessary. But
    luckily, the pointers are fixed size, so they’ll be easier to handle, and we
    don’t have to touch the cell section.</li>
</ul>

<div class="pl-10">
  <AnimationVideo
    src="/videos/slotted-page-insert.mp4"
    keyMoments={[
      { time: 1.5, text: "Insert cell 37" },
      { time: 4, text: "Rearrange pointers" },
      { time: 7, text: "Insert cell 28" },
      { time: 10, text: "Rearrange pointers" },
    ]}
    client:load
  />
</div>

<ul class="list-disc pl-10">
  <li><b>Lookup</b>: We still perform binary search as normal, but this time we
    need to follow the pointers to examine the keys.</li>
  <li><b>Delete</b>: Delete is probably even easier. Just delete the pointer
    and shift all pointers behind backward. The cell can be left as-is and
    considered as free space.</li>
</ul>

There’s still a small caveat we need to take care of. When deleting cells, we
leave some “holes” behind. These holes, while technically free spaces, can
make the page fragmented and reduce the storage efficiency.

<figure class="my-8 max-w-md mx-auto">
  <Image
    src={slottedPageFragmentation}
    alt="An illustration of slotted page fragmentation"
    class="mb-4"
  />
  <figcaption class="text-center text-sm italic">We cannot fit the new key, even though we have enough space.</figcaption>
</figure>

We can fix this in a few ways:

<ul class="list-disc pl-10">
  <li>Defragment the page by repacking the cells.</li>
  <li>Try to reuse free spaces when performing inserts.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The first option is too expensive to do on every insert. To amortize the cost,
  we can leave the holes to build up and perform a big repacking every once in a
  while (or have a background thread perform maintenance periodically). Reusing
  free spaces also helps but requires a mechanism to keep track of them
  (SQLite calls it the
  <a
    href="https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat.html#b_tree_pages"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    class="link">freeblock</a>).
</p>

### Concurrency

Databases must support concurrency accesses to B-Tree, both reads and writes. The current design is prone to race conditions.

Let's start with the simplest solution: **locks**. Every time we want to modify a
node, either insert or delete, acquire an exclusive lock on that node. It means
writes will block reads. But there’s a catch: we also have to acquire locks for
all nodes we traverse through in the path because we might need to modify
those nodes as well. In another word, during insertions and deletions, one
must acquire `h` locks, where `h` is the height of the tree. It can cause lock
contention at the root node, which reduces concurrency.

<p>
  B-link Tree, a variant of B-Tree, proposes a different way to approach this
  problem. PostgreSQL B-Tree implementation is based on this variant. We will
  discuss it further in
