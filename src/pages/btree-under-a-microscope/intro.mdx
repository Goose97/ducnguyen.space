B-Tree features in every data structure textbook, and its presence spans across
different areas. It is dubbed "ubiquitous" just 8 years after its creation. I
first encountered B-Tree through working with database indexes, specifically
PostgreSQL. Back then, I really thought that B-Tree stood for binary tree (oh
boy, I was wrong, big time).

Over the years, as I got more chances to work with it, read some blogs, and
watch some videos, I accumulated some knowledge about B-Tree. But I always feel
like there's a gap in my knowledge, as if I only scratched the surface of the
iceberg. My curiosity itched, and one day, I decided to sit down and learn
everything I could about B-Tree (spoiler alert, I failed; there are so many
things to learn). And that is the reason for this blog post - to document
everything I learned along the way.
