The one thing I love about B-Tree is that the core idea is crazy simple. I
can't help myself nodding enthusiastically while reading about it: "Hmm, this
makes sense. Anybody can think of this.". But before getting to B-Tree, let's
look at a simpler data structure, binary tree.

## B-Tree and binary tree

<p>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree" rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank" class="link">Binary tree</a>,
  like the name suggests, is a tree data structure. Each node has
  Binary tree, like the name suggests, is a tree data structure. Each node has
  two children. The left child contains all children smaller than the current
  node, and the right child contains all children bigger than the current node.
  The idea is to **divide the key space into smaller spaces on each level**.
  During lookup, as we traverse down the tree, the number of keys you have to
  search keeps shrinking.
</p>

B-Tree takes the core idea and tweaks it a bit. What if we can have more than
two children? Yes, that is B-Tree. The number of children is configurable,
commonly referred to as **degree** (or **order**) in academic literature. We
could consider binary tree as a special case of B-Tree with degree 2. We say
that B-Tree has higher fanout (the number of children a node can have) than
binary tree.

<Callout title="B+ Tree">
  <p>The term B-Tree refers to a family of data structures sharing a similar
    design. However, this post will choose
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%2B_tree"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      target="_blank"
      class="link"
    >B+ Tree</a>,
    a variant of B-Tree, as the
    baseline to discuss. The reason is B+ Tree is more popular nowadays and
    therefore more relevant. Most literature and implementations in databases
    (both MySQL and PostgreSQL) refer to them as B-Tree.</p>
  <p class="!mb-2">Here's the difference:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-10">
    <li>B-Tree allows storing values on any level: root, internal, and leaf
      nodes (like binary tree).</li>
    <li>B+ Tree stores values only in leaf nodes. Root and internal nodes store
      only separator keys used to guide the search algorithm to the associated
      value stored on the leaf level. More on this

        target="_blank"
        class="link"
      >later</a>.</li>
  </ul>
</Callout>

## Terminology and invariants

To establish a shared vocabulary, here are some terms that I will mention
throughout this blog post:

<ul class="list-disc pl-10">
  <li><strong>B-Tree degree k</strong>: this number determines the fanout of the tree.</li>
  <li>As we said above, B-Tree only stores values at the leaf nodes. We
    distinguish nodes into 3 types:</li>
  <ol class="list-decimal pl-10">
    <li><em>Root node:</em> this has no parents and is at the top of the tree.</li>
    <li><em>Leaf nodes:</em> these are the bottom layer nodes that have no
      child nodes. This is where we store values.</li>
    <li><em>Internal nodes:</em> these are nodes in between, connecting the
      root node to leaf nodes. They only store keys to separate the key space
      into different ranges. We call them <strong>separator keys</strong>.
      These nodes serve as guide posts to locate the correct leaf node that
      holds your key.</li>
  </ol>
</ul>

The design of B-Tree has a few invariants. Remember these, because they play a
big role in how the data structure operates, as well as choosing design
trade-offs.

<ol class="list-disc pl-10">
  <li>Given a tree with degree k, a node (except the root node) must have at
    least k children and at most 2k children. <strong>In another word, a node
      must always be at least half full.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>The keys inside each node must be ordered</strong>. This is not a
    strict requirement, but it's beneficial to maintain a sorted order. Most
    real implementations do this.</li>
</ol>

## Basic operations

Let's look through some basic operations that B-Tree support: lookup, insert and delete.

### Lookup

B-Tree can perform <em>single key lookup</em> (key = 42) or <em>range scan</em>
(30 < key < 40). For single key lookup, the process is comparable
to binary tree. This description outlines the algorithm's implementation:

<ol
  class="list-decimal pl-10">
  <li>Start at the root node.</li>
  <li>Choose the correct child that contains your target key by comparing it
    with the separator keys. Since the separator keys are sorted, we can
    perform binary search on them.</li>
  <li>Repeat step 2 to traverse down the tree.</li>
  <li>If you reach a leaf node and it contains your target key, the lookup
    ends. If the leaf node doesn't contain your target key, or you can't find
    the leaf node (there's no correct range in the internal nodes), it means
    your key does not exist in the data structure, and the lookup ends.</li>
</ol>

Let's look at an illustration of the lookup process:

  src="/videos/lookup.mp4"
  client:load

<p>
  Range scans start off by looking up the lower bound value. Once we found the
  lower bound, start scanning the sibling keys. Some B-Tree variants have
  <a
    href="/btree-under-a-microscope/optimizations#sibling-pointers"
    rel="noopener noreferrer"
    target="_blank"
    class="link">pointers between sibling nodes</a>,
  which can speed up the scanning phase.
</p>

### Insert

Since B-Tree is an ordered data structure, insertion needs to search for the
correct slot. After we find the place, we insert the new value into the leaf page.

But, there's a catch. Each node has a capacity of 2k keys, where k is the
degree of the B-Tree. If the leaf node is full, we say that the node is
*overflowed*. Two common approaches to dealing with this:

<ol class="list-decimal pl-10" start="1">
  <li><b>Split the overflowed node</b>: The overflowed node is split into two nodes.
    Choosing the split point is a problem on its own, but the most common way
    is to <em>split in the middle</em>. After that, a new separator key is
    added to the parent node to point to the newly split node. If the parent
    node is again overflowed, repeat the split process. The split process can
    cascade upward from the leaf all the way to the root. This is the way that
    B-Tree grows in height.</li>
</ol>

<div class="pl-10">
  <AnimationVideo
    src="/videos/insert-split.mp4"
    keyMoments={[
      { time: 1.5, text: "Find insert position" },
      { time: 7, text: "Insert and split leaf node" },
      { time: 12, text: "Split cascades up to internal node" },
      { time: 19, text: "Split cascades up to root node" },
      { time: 27, text: "Create new root node" },
    ]}
    client:load
  />
</div>

<ol class="list-decimal pl-10" start="2">
  <li><b>Redistribute the keys</b>: The keys from the overflowed node are
    redistributed to sibling nodes. Then, the parent node is updated to reflect
    the new changes.</li>
</ol>

<div class="pl-10">
  <AnimationVideo
    src="/videos/insert-redistribute.mp4"
    keyMoments={[
      { time: 1.5, text: "Find insert position" },
      { time: 7, text: "Insert new key" },
      { time: 12, text: "Redistribute keys" },
      { time: 15, text: "Update parent node" },
    ]}
    client:load
  />
</div>

### Delete

Same as insertion, you first lookup the key then delete it. Simple right?
Not so fast. Each node in B-Tree must include at least k children, where k is
the degree of the B-Tree. If the node has fewer children, we say that the node
is *underflowed*. Two common ways to solve this:

<ol class="list-decimal pl-10" start="1">
  <li><b>Redistribute the keys</b>: You can steal keys from sibling nodes.
    After that, update the parent node to adjust for the new key ranges.</li>
</ol>

<div class="pl-10">
  <AnimationVideo
    src="/videos/delete-redistribute.mp4"
    keyMoments={[
      { time: 1.5, text: "Lookup key" },
      { time: 8, text: "Delete key" },
      { time: 12, text: "Redistribute keys" },
      { time: 15, text: "Update parent node" },
    ]}
    client:load
  />
</div>

<ol class="list-decimal pl-10" start="2">
  <li><b>Merge with sibling nodes</b>: If there is enough space, two nodes can
    merge into one. After the merge, there will be one less child, and the
    parent node must be updated to reflect this. This in turn could cause the
    parent node to underflow, and again, you can choose to redistribute or
    merge. The merge process can cascade up to the root. When two last children
    of the root is merge, the root is removed and the newly merged node becomes
    the root. This is the way that B-Tree shrinks in height.</li>
</ol>

<div class="pl-10">
  <AnimationVideo
    src="/videos/delete-merge.mp4"
    keyMoments={[
      { time: 1.5, text: "Lookup key" },
      { time: 8, text: "Delete key" },
      { time: 11, text: "Merge nodes" },
      { time: 14, text: "Update parent node" },
    ]}
    client:load
  />
